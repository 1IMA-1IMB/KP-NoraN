        <h1>Ait is quite shockingly mentally ill</h1>

    <p>This is a case of those who know vs. those who don't know</p>

    <p>
        Generally as far as mental illnesses go, Ait is probably not the most noticibly ill one out of the population. However, that statement was true until three months ago.

    <p>
        Three months ago Ait would have seemed a quite respectable person, although a bit opinionated and oddly creative, not too much about their personality would've seemed truly- Maniacal may be a good word, though it may also come across as demeaning, so perhaps just- odd.

        Then came the 28th of July 2023, and changed that statement.
