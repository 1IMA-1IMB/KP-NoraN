    <h2>"The Commissioning Rule"</h2>

    <p>
        According to 
        <a href="https://www.copyright.co.nz/about/news-and-blog/whats-the-commissioning-rule">
            Copyright New Zealand
        </a> 
        all commissioned work automatically gives the client copyright, unless otherwise is agreed.
        
        <br><br>
        <h3>
            Exerpt from the site:
        </h3>

        <i>
            In the Copyright Act (1994) is a section titled “Ownership of 
            Copyright.” In that section, it states that "Where:
            <br><br>
                (a) a person commissions, and pays or agrees to pay for, the 
                taking of a photograph or the making of a computer program, 
                painting, drawing, diagram, map, chart, plan, engraving, model, 
                sculpture, film, or sound recording; and
                <br><br>
                (b) the work is made in pursuance of that commission, that 
                person is the first owner of any copyright in the work."
                <br><br>
            Loosely, and more widely known as “The Commissioning Rule,” this 
            means that if you, as an artist, are commissioned to create 
            something, and the person commissioning it pays or agrees to pay 
            you, the owner of the copyright is not you, but them.
        </i>
        <br><br>
        This- I would assume- would then extend to commercial commission 
        work such as movie posters.

    <p>
        These two posters are made by Rory Kurtz (Good Omens Season 2) and 
        Hokyoung Kim (Star Wars: The Bad Batch) and were both commissioned. 
        Though I personally believe credit should always be owed to the 
        artist, fact is that the copyright of these images belong to the 
        client (Amazon Prime and Walt Dsiney Studios Motion Pictures, respectively). 
        <br><br>
        If the artist or the commissioned party wishes to retain copyright ownership over 
        the artwork this must be explicitly stated in the commissioning 
        contract, if this is not done during the commissioning process 
        this must be negotiated between client and artist, and the client 
        (the owner) must give the artist permission to use the work for 
        any- and everything. 
        <br><br>
        For this reason many artists state that they 
        will still have partial ownership over the artwork and may use it 
        for self-promotion and may post it across social media. This ensures 
        that the artwork will not be used by the artist to gain money but 
        can still be used for personal self promotion.
